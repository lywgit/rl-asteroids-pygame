# Asteroids Gym Environment & RL Agent Execution Plan

## 1. Refactor Asteroids Game as a Gymnasium Environment

- **a. Isolate Game Logic:**  
  Refactor your game so that the core logic (game state, step, reset, render, etc.) is separated from the main loop and input handling.
- **b. Create Environment Class:**  
  Implement a class (e.g., `AsteroidsEnv`) that inherits from `gymnasium.Env`.
- **c. Define Spaces:**  
  - `observation_space`: Define the state representation (e.g., ship position, velocity, asteroids positions, etc.).
  - `action_space`: Define discrete or continuous actions (e.g., left, right, thrust, shoot).
- **d. Implement Gym Methods:**  
  - `reset()`: Reset the game state and return the initial observation.
  - `step(action)`: Apply an action, update the game state, return observation, reward, done, and info.
  - `render(mode)`: Render the game using Pygame (for both human and agent).
  - `close()`: Clean up resources.

## 2. Human and Agent Playability

- **a. Human Play:**  
  - Implement a mode where keyboard input is mapped to actions and passed to `step()`.
  - Use `render(mode="human")` to display the game.
- **b. Agent Play:**  
  - Allow the agent to select actions and call `step()` programmatically.
  - Still use `render(mode="human")` for visualization during training or evaluation.

## 3. Reinforcement Learning Integration

- **a. Observation/Reward Design:**  
  - Decide what information the agent observes.
  - Design a reward function (e.g., +1 for destroying an asteroid, -1 for losing a life).
- **b. RL Algorithm:**  
  - Use your RL repo as a base (e.g., DQN, PPO).
  - Integrate your environment with the RL training loop.
- **c. Training:**  
  - Train the agent using the environment.
  - Periodically render episodes for evaluation.

## 4. Testing and Evaluation

- **a. Manual Testing:**  
  - Play the game as a human to ensure the environment works.
- **b. Agent Testing:**  
  - Run trained agents and visualize their performance.

**Next Steps:**  
Start by refactoring your game logic and creating the `AsteroidsEnv` class following the Gymnasium template. Let me know if you want a code template for the environment class!
