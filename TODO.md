# Asteroids AI Project Development TODO list

## Done

- [x] initial development of rainbow dqn techniques

## Tasks
ROADMAP 3.3.1:
- [ ] Refactor code to use model_config for better MLOps.
    - [ ] model checkpoint should be saved with proper config information so when loaded it can be correctly initialized accordingly and automatically.  
    - [ ] make sure models of all different dqn technique combinations (dueling x noisy x distributional) can be save load correctly.
    - [ ] update play_dqn_model.py.    
- [ ] fix print/log messages for noisy network (not epsilon but other better metrics)


## Backlog

- [ ] review v1.0 experiments results
    - [ ] evaluate reward
    - [ ] compare hyperparameters
    - [ ] record best video for demo
